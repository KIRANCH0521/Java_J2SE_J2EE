1.2 On click of Vendor ID hyper link, navigate to ViewDetails.jsp , which displays details of corresponding vendor. (Hint - Use query string to pass Vendor ID on click of hyperlink)
1.3 On click of 'Add Vendor Record' button, navigate to insert.jsp , which should display a form -- to Accept -- Vendor Name,City and Phone no. Add submit button 'Insert Vendor' 

1.4 On click of 'Insert Vendor' button --- navigate to servlet -- InsertServlet which will do ---
